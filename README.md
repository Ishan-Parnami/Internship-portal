# Backend Project

This is the backend part of a MERN stack project. It is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The backend provides APIs for user authentication, profile management, and managing opportunities.

## Features

- User authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Profile management
- CRUD operations for opportunities
- Secure API with input validation

## Installation

Before you start, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo/backend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your MongoDB database and update the `.env` file with your database URI.

## Running the Project

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The server will run on `http://localhost:4000` by default.

## Project Structure

```
/src
  /controllers   # Controller functions for handling requests
  /models        # Mongoose models
  /routes        # API route definitions
  /middlewares   # Middleware functions
  /config        # Configuration files
  server.js      # Entry point
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your backend project to store environment-specific variables:

```
PORT=4000
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

- `PORT`: The port number the server will listen on.
- `MONGODB_URI`: The connection string for your MongoDB database.
- `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key for signing JSON Web Tokens.

## API Endpoints
