   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

1. Ensure that the backend server is running.

## Project Structure

```
/src
  /components    # Reusable components
  /pages         # Page components
  /utils         # Utility functions
  /styles        # Global styles
  App.js         # Main application component
  index.js       # Entry point
```

## Configuration

### Axios Configuration

The base URL for axios requests is set in the `App.js` file:

```javascript
axios.defaults.baseURL = 'http://localhost:4000';
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;
```

You can change this URL to point to your backend server. It's recommended to use environment variables for different environments (development, production, etc.).

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project to store environment-specific variables:

```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

## Usage

### Authentication

- **Login**: Users can log in using their credentials.
- **Signup**: New users can create an account.

### Dashboard

- **View Profile**: Users can view their profile details and applied opportunities.
- **Edit Profile**: Users can edit their profile details.

## Dependencies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **React Router**: Declarative routing for React applications.
